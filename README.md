# Bitcoin Price Prediction Frontend 

This project is a **practice-based frontend web application** built to understand how real-time data can be fetched and displayed using **APIs**. The main focus of this project was **learning and experimentation**, not production-level prediction.

Although the project was developed and practiced back in **2024**, it is being uploaded now to properly document and preserve the learning work on GitHub.

---

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to:
- Practice **frontend development**
- Learn how to **consume external APIs**
- Display **dynamic Bitcoin price data**
- Improve understanding of **state management and async data fetching**

This project was created purely for **learning and hands-on practice**.

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, we practiced and learned:
- How APIs work and how to integrate them into a frontend app
- Handling asynchronous requests using `fetch` / `axios`
- Managing component state in React
- Structuring a basic React project
- Using Git for version control

---

## Project Timeline

- **Development & Practice:** 2024  
- **Uploaded to GitHub:** Later (for documentation and portfolio purposes)

---

## Disclaimer

This project **does not provide real Bitcoin price prediction**.  
It is a **frontend practice project** created only for learning API integration and React concepts.

---

## Contribution

This repository reflects **practice work done collaboratively or individually** as part of learning frontend development. 

---

## Acknowledgment

Built as a learning exercise to strengthen frontend and API concepts.
